# Link Site Theme for Gatsby

Before the times of Reddit and Hacker News it was quite common for homepages to have link sections.

I miss those times, but I realisticially am not going to update one. But I do bookmark things and I do star things on Github.

So this gatsby-theme adds a "/links" page to your site and fetches data from Pinboard and/or Github.
